Hello!
Welcome to my first Profile page. I will be attempting to two different styles, and make the second one using only Flexbox instead of the grid that I used in this one. 
This is only using CSS and HTML, so a very basic profile page, The links have a background hover, that link you to their associated sections. The images in the portfolio will link you to the associated pages. 
Clicking the eye in the footer will reload the page.
